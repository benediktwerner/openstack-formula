# OpenStack Salt Formulas for SUSE Manager
These formulas can be used to set up a basic OpenStack cloud with salt on SUSE systems.
They are meant to be used together with [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/de-de/products/suse-manager) which allows you to easily configure the cloud setup via the GUI.

**These formulas are only an example for the SUSE Manager Salt Formulas framework and are not meant for production.**

**If you want to deploy an OpenStack cloud for production, take a look at [SUSE OpenStack Cloud](https://www.suse.com/de-de/products/suse-openstack-cloud), which might also be using Salt soon.**
