things to do, that are not in the github repo, to get formulas working on SUMA:
  - update suma_minion.py in /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar (file is on github)
  - include formulas in /usr/share/susemanager/salt/top.sls
  - create /usr/share/susemanager/salt/formulas directory
  - add init.sls (also on github) to the directory
  - add this file root in susemanager.conf: /usr/share/susemanager/salt/formulas
